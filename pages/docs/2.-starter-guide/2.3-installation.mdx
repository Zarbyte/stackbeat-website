## Linux

Run the following one-line command to download and run the installer.

```
wget -O /opt/stackbeat-linux-installer.sh https://stackbeat.tech/download/stackbeat-linux-installer.sh && bash /opt/stackbeat-linux-installer.sh
```

### Configuration

Adjusting settings at this stage is optional. The default settings will function for initial setup and testing purposes. You can always adjust the settings later.

If you would like to adjust them now, view `/opt/stackbeat/config.ini` and set as appropriate for your needs.

### Running the services

Start the `main` service on the main monitoring server:

```
stackbeat main
```

Start the `monitor` service on all systems you want monitored and reporting back to the main.

```
stackbeat monitor
```

The `main` service has a thread for self-monitoring. It will collect and report its own stats into memory and report the hostname as main. You will not need to run an additional `monitor` service if you want the `main` monitored. If you **do not** want `main monitored`, you can disable `Main Self Monitoring` in `config.ini`.



## Windows
