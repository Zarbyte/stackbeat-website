# Product Documentation

StackBeat (SB) is an infrastructure and personal device monitoring tool created by [Zarbyte](https://zarbyte.com).

SB is a self-hosted solution that is primarily controlled through a `main` service. You can then link an unlimited about of `monitor` services to the `main` service.

The default interface is powered by **LavishUI**. The frontend API allows you to build your own interface.

We realize there are many monitoring solutions out there. Our goal isn't to provide you with anything you haven't already seen before. Our goal is to provide you with an intuitive experience you will appreciate and utilize in both personal and professional environments.

We hope you enjoy learning about StackBeat as much as we enjoyed created it.
